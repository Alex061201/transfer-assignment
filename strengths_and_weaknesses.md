# Strengths
1. Git is useful at efficiently tracking the changes and the overall development of a project, giving you a full history of the project.
2. Git enables you to work collaboratively with people (from all over the world) on your projects.

# Weaknesses
1. When working with multiple branches (and together with multiple people), projects are prone to run into merge conflicts, where a file has different versions in different branches, which creates problems when those branches get merged.
