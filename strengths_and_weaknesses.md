# Strengths
1. Git is useful at efficiently tracking the changes and the overall development of a project, giving you a full history of the project.
2. Git enables you to work collaboratively with people (from all over the world) on your projects.

# Weaknesses
1. When working with multiple branches (and together with multiple people), projects are prone to run into merge conflicts, where a file has different versions in different branches, which creates problems when those branches get merged.
2. You need to actively use git while working on your project, meaning you have to always have an overview on all the different active branches and know which of your changes are staged and commited within those branches. It is not passively running in the background while you work on your project.
